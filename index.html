    <h1>mammoths</h1>
    <p>
        lat. Mammuthus is an extinct genus of mammals of the order Proboscidea, which existed from the Pliocene (5 million years ago) to the beginning of the Holocene (about 4 thousand years ago). Their various species inhabited the biotopes of Africa, Europe, Asia and North America. The family they belonged to, the elephant family, also includes two genera of modern elephants, along with their ancestors. Genetically, mammoths were closer to modern Asian elephants than to African ones. Animals usually had long, curved tusks, and species living in polar regions had long hair. They reached a height of 5.5 meters and a body weight of 14-15 tons; Thus, mammoths were twice as heavy as the largest modern land mammals, African elephants
